## Tips

1. **Save Tokens**: After login, save the token and use it in subsequent requests
2. **Test in Order**: Follow the testing workflow to properly test the application
3. **Check Firestore**: Verify data is being saved in Firebase Console
4. **Use Variables**: In Postman, create environment variables for:
   - `baseUrl`: http://localhost:5000/api
   - `jobseekerToken`: Token from jobseeker login
   - `employerToken`: Token from employer login
   - `jobId`: ID of created job
   - `applicationId`: ID of created application

## Postman Collection

You can import this as a Postman collection or use it as a reference for manual testing.

## Expected Results

After completing the workflow:

- 2 users created in Firestore (jobseeker & employer)
- 1 job posting created
- 1 job application submitted
- Application visible to both jobseeker and employer
- Application status can be updated by employer

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

- Check if token is included in Authorization header
- Check if token is valid (not expired)
- Format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### 403 Forbidden

- Check if user role has permission for this action
- Example: Only employers can create jobs

### 400 Bad Request

- Check request body format
- Verify all required fields are included
- Check validation rules (password strength, email format, etc.)

### 404 Not Found

- Verify the endpoint URL is correct
- Check if the resource ID exists

Happy Testing! 🚀
